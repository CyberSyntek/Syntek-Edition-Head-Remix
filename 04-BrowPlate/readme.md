- x5 - MG90D or MG92B Servos Motors.

  Note: I have currently been using MG90D servo motors for these parts. I believe the MG92B may work better having a bit more torque, but I don't have enough   on hand at the moment. I will update when I get a chance to try some. 

- Arduino Nano + Mini B USB Cable (3FT)

- PCA9685

- Raspberry Pi Zero W + SD Card + Micro USB (3ft) if not included with Raspi Zero W. 

- MPU6050 (Currenly optional. It is slotted on the BrowPlate, but I need to experiment still)
