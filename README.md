I will update with some better pics and will generally be updating many of the pages on this github writeup over the next few weeks and onward for the code sides of things. But most importantly, the STL files and write ups for how to put them together and what is needed are already available. 

I may need to change a few things on the pages tomorrow as I'm pretty tired and want to go to bed soon, so if you see this page tonight then perhaps look through it and wait a day for any last minute updates before jumping on the project. :9

- 05-Skull - I got some images up tonight but haven't done the write up information relating to them yet. Tomorrow~

WHAT IS THE SYNTEK EDITION REMIXED HEAD?
= 
*INSERT IMAGE OR VIDEO HERE* 

It is a mostly magnetically held remixed edition of Gael Langevin (InMoov Founder)'s InMoov robot head that has been fit with independent eyes, eyelids, eyebrows and an additional axis in the jaw. This head is controlled via a PCA9685 micro controller, an Arduino Nano and MYROBOTLAB and can be built to function independently or as part of your InMoov robot. 

FIRST TIME USING A PCA9865 AND MYROBOTLAB?
=
No problem! Here is my "Beginners guide to moving servos with a PCA9685 and MYROBOTLAB" video to help you get started.
