# Syntek-Edition-Head-Remix
Here you will find the Syntek edition remixed head files, info to get it running and updates as they come.

- Most of the current files are uploaded here with the exception of two eyebrow related parts I need to adjust. 

- It is possible to print and use the head with the currenly available uploaded parts without eyebrows till those parts are finished if wishing to do so. 

*TO BE UPDATED*
- ALOT! :D

////BOM//// - Links included are just for reference. If you can them find locally, cheaper or similar parts more easily, then please do so.

PUPIL CAMERA RELATED ITEMS
=

#Note - Coming from the original Inmoov USB webcam pupil camera setup, I had decided I would stick with that route for my current pupil camera setup also by converting a Raspberry Pi Zero W into a webcam and using it in the same fashion. This isn't the most cost effective route for doing these things, but the size of the camera modules I found worked for the job. I am sure there are other options out there and I do plan on formatting the eyeball camera inserts for at least one other type of raspberry pi spy camera and will update those files here with a potential set up description when I have completed them. 

The following items are required for my current setup. 

- x1 - Raspberry Pi Zero - https://a.co/d/f5wQHNF

  Raspberry Pi Zero, Zero W and Zero 2 W? should all work. There seems to be a shortage of them available during the time of writing this, but using what       ever you can locate should do the job.

- x1 - SD Card

- x1 - USB cable if not included with Raspberry Pi Zero. 

- x1 - 8MP Camera Module for Raspberry Pi 77.6° Wide Angle Field View Camera Module for Raspberry Pi - https://a.co/d/1mauetZ 

  The link description says 5MP for some reason, but the cam cable has 8MP written on it as well as the comments confirming 8MP. These are available from       various sellers. 

- x1 - Raspberry Pi Camera Module V2 - https://a.co/d/2dx2Vhr

  Make sure you are using the V2. Unfortunetly it is very difficult to find just these boards without a camera included as we will NOT be using the included   camera due to needing a longer cable to be able to reach into the eyeball with enough cable slack to still function.

- x1 - 11.8" (30cm) Raspberry Pi Zero Camera Ribbon Flex Extension Cable - https://a.co/d/2RXyKAD

  We need a Raspberry Pi camera module > Raspberry Pi Zero camera cable.
  
================================================================================  

I recommend the following youtube video as a walkthrough for getting your Raspberry Pi Zero W's SD card formatted to function as a webcam. Her instructions are clear and the whole process takes about 2 minutes. 

"How to build a Raspberry Pi webcam | Easy beginner project!" - https://youtu.be/zmP1ZuV4kB8

The link she included in the video description is not the same as what she uses in the video. Here is the correct link to save you any headaches. https://github.com/showmewebcam/showmewebcam/tags

NEODYMIUM MAGNETS
=

#Note - I used the "NAZZO" brand of neodymium magnets found in the provided links as they are very strong and work well for our needs. I ordered two of the mixed sized packs as I was experimenting and wanted some size options to playu with. This is the link for the mixed pack I used. https://a.co/d/1fMVASk

Other options of that brand would be to get a pack of each of the sizes used if you are unable to source the needed neodymium magnets sizes needed locally.

- Krazy Glue/Super Glue (Please find locally for cheaper, but just incase) - https://a.co/d/6VbvxNa

- Mini B USB Cable (3FT) https://a.co/d/219j3qb

  If using either Jon Bailey's headstand set up (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4670770) or have the head attached to the body of your Inmoov, 
  3FT should give you plenty of room to work with. The Mini B USB cable provided with the Arduino Nano will be too short.
