SKULL INFORMATION
=
The skull reshaping to allow for this to design to come together could not have happened without the wonderful help of Harry "Haracini". 

Random Note
=
You may have noticed in the pictures that my Eyebrows are leaving marks on my painted head. I still haven't painted it with a protective layer so that will happen hopefully this week and some photos will be updated. I am hoping that will do the job of preventing such things and I will update once I have repainted and given him a protective coat to confirm that will do the job. For those of you NOT painting, you have nothing to worry about. :)

WARNING: Some of the files may look different than the original tutorial as they have been updated and adjusted to meet other changes in the build so far. I will update the images to match the parts eventually. 

- FrontSkull.stl (Requires Supports)

- BackSkull.stl (Requires Supports)  Note: Printable as is, but I plan on making a more print friendly version eventually. 

- SkullCap.stl (Requires Supports)

- RotNeckGear.stl

  #Note: You will want to download some ears from the InMoov website.

SCREWS / BOLTS / CONNECTORS
=
- x8 - Servo Screws

- x2 - M4x16mm bolts. Note: I generally use slightly larger selftap screws on this for a stronger steady hold.

MAGNETS
= 
- x18 - 10x3mm Neodymium Magnets 

OTHER
=
- Superglue

TUTORIAL
=
IT IS FINALLY TIME TO HAVE A FACE!

MAGNET PREP
=
To start you will want to make x9 pairs of 10x3mm Neodymium Magnets and mark each side of each pairs back side with a marker. This way we will know the polarity of the set and which side will be inserted into the printer parts.
![Magnets001](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81597534/185184115-83428246-6a6f-4017-85f1-b3904da04044.png)

Checking the Slots
=
You will want to place the magnets into their slotted locations on the Front/Back and Cap of the skull to make sure that they can fit in easily and have enough room that they will be either flush with the part or slightly lower. If they are not you will want to file out the inner parts until they are so that you do not have any gaps in the skull pieces. 

Once you are sure everything is a nice fit, we will want to glue them into their slots with some superglue. As you can see my magnets on this first tester skull are not pretty as I used too much glue to make sure they would fit. You likely only need a single drop.

![Flush002](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81597534/185014301-62cc1450-9454-4277-8b1b-1eb52190d3fd.png)

Attaching the RotNeck Servo
=
You will screw in the servo with x4 servo screws and the servo wire facing towards the left side of the skull. At this time you will have NOTHING attached to the servo side. We will want this servo set to 90Â° / Centered before we attach the RotNeck gear so either adjust it before attaching or after.

It can be a little tricky to get a screw driver in and around the magnet slots, but you should be able to manage. 

To prepare the RotNeckGear we will want to take the round servo horn with the screw that will attach it to the servo placed in the center of the servo horn and screw it to the RotNeckGear using x4 servo screws or similar sized screws. We will then line up the RotNeckGear and place it on the Servo. You will need a smaller screw driver like that which likely came with your 3d printer to be able to fit it into the center of the RotNeckGear and screw the servo horn to the servo.  

Finally you may wish to apply a little bit of grease to the RotNeckGear.

ATTACHING THE BACKSKULL
=
You will want to angle the BackSkull onto the MainPlate and try and line up the RotNeckGear with the slot on the MainPlate as seen below.

![BackSkull001](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81597534/185015717-171d682e-1ad8-4389-a71d-a9e6be1cc039.png)

Hold the skull in place so that it is leveled and screw it into the MainPlate using x2 M4x16 bolts OR more recommended similar sized self-tapping screws so that it really has a secure grip. 

![Hold001](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81597534/185015619-f5b52bbd-8318-4f9d-927a-2a97f5102526.png)

You may find that it is hard to get the skull into a straight position and that the wires from your Raspi/Arduino/Power are getting in the way. I recommend that you give those cables enough slack that you can push the skull on and adjust the cables following having your BackSkull attached.

![WireyStuff0001](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81597534/185189328-9d0c5114-37de-4287-bf2e-ff8f46222e86.png)

Inspect around the RotNeckGear to make sure that there are no cables able to come in contact with it and potentially get stuck. 

![WireCheck001](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81597534/185015918-9c5313c9-091e-4cae-b135-f15dacec6e91.png)

We will want to make sure that all the servo cables are behind the magnet slots so that the front skull will fit on without them getting stuck in between. This is the time when you may wish to apply a few more zipties to make sure your cables are clear and out of the way.

![WireyStuff](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81597534/185189476-b6e06544-0d93-400e-b6d0-a24feef94891.png)

ATTACHING THE FRONTSKULL
=
You will want to open the Jaw to its maximum range so that you have more room to work with while attaching the Front Skull. Woops! Make sure to check you don't have any eyebrows still on there!

WARNING: You will NEED to be very careful with getting around these bolts on both sides of the head. It is very tight, but with a slight flex of the skull and or some angling magic, you should be able to clear it without issue. I would suggest trying to clear one sides bolt one at a time until you manage and then it should go on easily from there.

Check to see that the magnets are all lined up and that the height looks to match with the eyes.

![MaskOn001](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81597534/185016796-2e071bd3-0c41-47d1-bf7f-44b605c39d65.png)

Now you can attach the TPUbrows, close up his jaw and your head is finally all together. 

![BrowsOn001](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81597534/185017592-76b644e8-d346-4038-abf9-de3f5f8c8981.png)

Congratulations! Your new head is now all put together and you are ready enter the wonderful world of playing with it and expanding it's functionality.
