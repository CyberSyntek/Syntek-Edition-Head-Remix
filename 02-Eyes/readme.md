Take x6 BaseConnect pieces and slot them into the MainPlate for whichever side eye you decide to start with. Screw them together from the bottom side using x6 M2x8mm screws. I will be using the right side eye in these examples.

Take your "Base" piece and line up the correct holes with the "BaseConnector"s and screw them together with x6 M2-12mm screws.

Apply a drop of superglue to where Base and BaseConnector are now joined at the bottom of the Base. This will prevent the baseconnectors from being able to rotate. Give the glue a few minutes to dry and come back.

Unscrew the x6 screws from the bottom of the Mainplate and remove the Base. Now you will be able to apply a bit more superglue with easier access to the bottom of the Base. After the glue dries you can either remove the x6 M2x12mm screws or leave them in, it doesn't really matter. (I leave them in for added strength.)

![Superglue2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81597534/183110196-72fdbead-a54c-47d3-bd4d-9fda751a848e.png)

With the BaseConnectors superglued to the Base and locking them into place unable to rotate, we can now remove the Base as a single unit by simply removing the x6 screws on the bottom of the MainPlate and plug it back into the MainPlate BaseConnector slots when needing to do so.

Now you will need to repeat the steps above for the opposite side eye.
