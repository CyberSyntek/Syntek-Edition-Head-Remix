ABOUT
=

The eye mechanism is a direct remix of Will Cogley's "Compact Animatronic Eye Mechanism" in which I have seperate both sides of the eyes to be independent mechanisms, modified to use independent eyelids, fit the eyeballs with cameras and reworked to allow for it to fit inside of the Syntek Edition InMoov skull. (Plus a few other changes.)

This mechanism could not have been done without the hard work of Will Cogley putting together his original eye mech. I would like to send out a huge thank you to Will for his hard work and for giving me permission to post the remixed files for others to use. Thanks Will!

NOTE: This eye mechanism is still compatible with Will's original eyes. You can head over to his site and download his eye files there if you are not planning on using cameras in your build. He also has various videos on his youtube channel relating to eye mechanisms and how to make realistic looking eyes as well as a resin cast kit for his original eyes with the files for those available on his website.

Here is a link to Will Cogley's "How to Make a Compact Animatronic Eye Mechanism with 3D Printing and Arduino" video. Give it a watch through as it may help as a reference for various things relating to this eye mechanism as well. https://youtu.be/ihXxbQefl1c

==========================================

Take x6 BaseConnect pieces and slot them into the MainPlate for whichever side eye you decide to start with. Screw them together from the bottom side using x6 M2x8mm screws. I will be using the right side eye in these examples. 

![001-BaseConnectorToMainPlate](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81597534/183090041-8436b93d-4ae6-4eb3-9403-0bdd41b33f2e.png)

Take your "Base" piece and line up the correct holes with the "BaseConnector"s and screw them together with x6 M2-12mm screws.

![002-BaseToBaseConnector](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81597534/183090642-d331a9ee-f9ad-4673-be0a-a838b803b3c1.png)

Apply a drop of superglue to where Base and BaseConnector are now joined at the bottom of the Base. This will prevent the baseconnectors from being able to rotate. Give the glue a few minutes to dry and come back. 

![Superglue1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81597534/183108955-35bc3971-67f6-45ba-bdec-01f4cc284ff4.png)

Unscrew the x6 screws from the bottom of the Mainplate and remove the Base. Now you will be able to apply a bit more superglue with easier access to the bottom of the Base. After the glue dries you can either remove the x6 M2x12mm screws or leave them in, it doesn't really matter. (I leave them in for added strength.)

![Superglue2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81597534/183110196-72fdbead-a54c-47d3-bd4d-9fda751a848e.png)

With the BaseConnectors superglued to the Base and locking them into place unable to rotate, we can now remove the Base as a single unit by simply removing the x6 screws on the bottom of the MainPlate and plug it back into the MainPlate BaseConnector slots when needing to do so. 

Now you will need to repeat the steps above for the opposite side eye. 

![003-GluedEyeBase](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81597534/183121338-0f12281c-2755-4570-abd0-49ab5833f36b.PNG)

Now it is time to mount the L/R and U/D servos for the eye mechanisms. With your servos preset to 90° (centered) mount them as seen in the image below and screw them in using some servo screws. 

#Note: I used some standard size servo screws here to make sure they had a solid hold, but you should be able to use the servo screws that come with your servos.

The servo horns will be mounted facing towards the outsides of the mechanisms.

![005-EyeServos](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81597534/183121062-442a7469-d898-46f5-a4a3-00241b637558.png)

Slide your servo wires through the top holes on the ServoHolder. Screw the servos onto the ServoHolder using x2 Servo Screws then mount the ServoHolder onto the Base and screw it on using x3 M2x12mm screws. Now we will add the otherside x2 servo screws to secure the servos in place.

These servos will also be centered / set to 90° when mounted.

Finally we will add the servo horns onto the servos in the positions seen below. 

![06-ServoHolderServosToBase](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81597534/183127965-26979c00-c43d-49b3-8d6c-b6b64a11ca74.png)

Now we will screw on the Eyelid holder to the side of the Base using x3 M2x7mm screws.

![07-EyelidHolder](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81597534/183221236-3030e186-a5c8-4b31-9f12-5e6a544f0d23.png)

Align and screw together the BaseExtension and the EyeHolder using a M2x12mm screw. Once you are sure it is lined up well, you may want to apply a drop of superglue to prevent it shifting as the servos move which could offset the eyes movement. 
![08-BaseExtension](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81597534/183222149-6ce3b23a-8830-4431-b611-c281fa502409.png)

Cable Clips to MainPlate (Insert Info)

Attach the Raspi camera V2 module, run cable throw cable clips and attach the camera cable to the module. (You can do this step more easily with the jaw removed, but you may wish to wait until later in the set up to attach this stuff to ensure you keep your camera cables in best possible condition.

Now you have your eye mechanisms all set up! It is time begin setting up the Jaw.
