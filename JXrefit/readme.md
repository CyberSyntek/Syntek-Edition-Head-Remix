These files are for the JX PDI-1181 x12 and PDI-1109 x3 updated version of the head. 

I will need to update the github further and revamp the tutorials to use these files as they preform much better than the previous version which used MG90D.
The jaw required more torque to perform well and the PDI-1181 servos preform much better than MG90D/MG92B/etc tested so far.
