These files are for the JX PDI-1181 x12 and PDI-1109 x3 updated version of the head. 

I will need to update the github further and revamp the tutorials to use these files as they preform much better than the previous version which used MG90D.
The jaw required more torque to perform well and the PDI-1181 servos preform much better than MG90D/MG92B/etc tested so far.

These are the files I am currently using. 

The only thing I will mention is that on my current MainPlate the MainGear slot was a bit tight and I needed to sand it a little bit. I have expanded that by 0.20mm to hopefully overcome that, but I would need to reprint to know for sure. Maybe one of you can let me know how that works out.
