These files are for if you want to add the lower teeth. After testing a little bit with them, due to the weight of the teeth there is a little bit of rattle so I may need to further alter them a bit eventually. 

So far I just stuck a little bit of silly putty on the underside of it to prevent any noise and it works fine.

I believe the screw size was M2x8mm from HingeCover to Teeth. 

These are optional files of course. :)
