TUTORIAL

JAW PREP
=

We will prepare a few of the individual parts before we attach them all together in the next 3 steps.

L&R Hinges to Jaw
=
Screw in x4 M3x12mm Bolts to connect both side Hinges to the Jaw. This area can be tight on a screw driver, but you should be able to manage with playing the angles.

HingeLink Prep
=
Screw in the Ball Joint piece from either a 2-56 or M2 Threaded Ball Link into the HingeLink until it sits flush.

HingeBase to ServoConnectors
=

First we will insert x2 M2 Nuts into the HingeBase. Ideally we will use a little bit of superglue to keep it held in. Next we will line up the Servo Connectors with the HingeBase and screw in a Mx16 Bolt through to the M2 Nuts. You want the ServoConnectors to still be able to swing around freely so make sure not to over tighten them. Just enough that there is no play between the HingeBase and ServoConnectors. You may also wish to carefully apply a little drop of the on the tip of the bolt where it is connected to the nut so that it doesn't slip over time.

Assemble the Above
=

Now we will attach all of the above parts we just prepared. You should be able to manage to get the HingeBase into the circular slots on the Hinges at this point without much trouble. When inserting it make sure that the side with the M2 Nuts is facing the top. 

Slide the HingeLink between the Hinges with the Ball Joint on the top side and screw in x4 M2x12mm Screws so that everything is held together.

HingeCover to Jaw
= 

Flip the Jaw over and screw the HingeCover on using x4 M2x8mm Screws. This HingeCover is completely optional and was made to avoid the hollow mouth look.
