TUTORIAL
= 
We will prepare a few of the individual parts before we attach them all together in the next 3 steps.

L&R Hinges to Jaw
=
Screw in x4 M3x12mm Bolts to connect both side Hinges to the Jaw. This area can be tight on a screw driver, but you should be able to manage with playing the angles.

![00-Jaw](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81597534/183467555-c32bcf38-1af8-4a53-9acc-6a3016f88edb.png)

HingeLink Prep
=
Screw in the Ball Joint piece from either a 2-56 or M2 Threaded Ball Link into the HingeLink until it sits flush.

![02-HingeLink](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81597534/183464797-c5dd10a6-6462-44e6-ba61-9668360c5049.png)

BallLinkConnector Prep
=

Take x2 M2x20mm Bolts and cut the bolt heads off of them. Screw in the bolt rod pieces into the x2 Threaded Ball Link pieces as seen in image. Screw those into each side of the BallLinkConnector.stl file and make sure that the empty ball joints are both facing the same direction. We will be putting this piece aside until the "03-BrowPlate" tutorial. Keep it and the remaining x1 ball joint in a safe place until ready to use it! 

![BallLinkConnector](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81597534/183727180-1b6c2c89-4b25-4c81-90db-59b1942b35c3.png)

HingeBase to ServoConnectors
=

Note: The servoconnectors are now ServoConnectorsV2 and will appear different. See "Lateral Jaw Servo Horns" below for the updated image. 

First we will insert x2 M2 Nuts into the HingeBase. Ideally we will use a little bit of superglue to keep it held in. Next we will line up the Servo Connectors with the HingeBase and screw in a Mx16 Bolt through to the M2 Nuts. You want the ServoConnectors to still be able to swing around freely so make sure not to over tighten them. Just enough that there is no play between the HingeBase and ServoConnectors. You may also wish to carefully apply a little drop of the on the tip of the bolt where it is connected to the nut so that it doesn't slip over time.

![01-HingeBase](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81597534/183464934-72e2ff89-d336-4fad-b290-4da92b07d21c.png)

Assemble the Above
=

Now we will attach all of the above parts we just prepared. You should be able to manage to get the HingeBase into the circular slots on the Hinges at this point without much trouble. When inserting it make sure that the side with the M2 Nuts is facing the top. 

Slide the HingeLink between the Hinges with the Ball Joint on the top side and screw in x4 M2x12mm Screws so that everything is held together.

HingeCover to Jaw
= 

Flip the Jaw over and screw the HingeCover on using x4 M2x8mm Screws. This HingeCover is completely optional and was made to avoid the hollow mouth look.

![04-HingeCover](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81597534/183470158-0fed6902-6afb-44f3-854e-95c16b9e5881.png)

Lateral Jaw Servo Selection
=
We need two servos with similar servo spline to servo horn orientations as we will be running these servos with a Y cable through a single pin on the same signal. Make sure that both of your servos are able to hit the same servo horn position for both servos or try swapping out some different servo horns on the servos until you can find a good matching set. 

Y-Cable
= 
You will want a Y cable such as this one or you can make your own with some servo extension cables. Make sure to test the servos running together and that they are moving in sync and to the expected positions. 

![YCable](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81597534/183519057-1fa093bd-a743-479b-996e-29654be3ef37.png)

Lateral Jaw Servos and Cutting the Tips
=

Lateral Jaw Servo Horns
=
We will be screwing in x4 M2x8mm bolts from the top side of the servo horn into the ServoConnectors which are now fit with x2 M2 nuts on the bottom sides. 
The bolts will be inserted into the 2nd and 5th from the center of the servo horn holes as seen below.

![V2ServoConnector](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81597534/185965476-6d050ca2-4481-4a79-8f04-e14f64da80b5.png)

Zip Ties
=

You will want to attach a ziptie around each of the current jaw servos that we have attached so far. First begin by running the servo cable along the inside open area beside the servo. Tighten a ziptie around the servo and push it downwards so hold the servo cable in place. The ziptie should also be able to slide down into the openings on both sides of the servo. The reason for this is that we want the cables running towards the front and staying away from the back as we will later have a gear for the neck located close by and we don't want our cables to get caught and chewed up in it. 
![Zip](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81597534/183519041-8353d7ec-9a40-4bed-a6eb-a3b3caa52bce.png)

You will likely need to disconnect the servos from the Y cable to be able to get the wires through the following (03-BrowPlate) steps, so keep it somewhere safe after you have tested the servos working together.

Neck & Cable Planning
=
It is right around this stage that you want to begin to plan what you are going to be attaching the head to and what preparation needs to be done as far as the cables you will be needing to run through the neck. Regardless if you are using the a head stand or attaching it directly to your InMoov's body, it will be much easier to get your cables ready and through whichever neck you decide to use at this stage in the build before we add even more into the head.

If you are following the same set up as myself then you will see below that I am currently running a total of x4 cables through the neck and Maingear.
 
- +/- cables which will connect to the PCA9685's terminal block to power the servo motors.

- 3ft Mini B USB cable to power the Arduino Nano. (3ft)

  Note: The default cable that came with the nano was too short with the BackSkull attached.

- Micro USB to power the Raspberry Pi Zero W

![Cableplanning](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81597534/183519089-99653fc9-c202-4c75-87dd-482cbe7d977c.png)

Once you have your cables through, you will want to reattach the MainGear to the MainPlate with the GearRing from the parts that we printed earlier in the MainPlate section using the x4 M3x12mm Bolts.

![NeckMainGear](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81597534/183766152-ad5b2d67-f600-421a-8c18-da04a2f7bff7.png)

You will want to attach the MainGear to the NeckPlateHigh file from the InMoov website using x4 M3x16mm Bolts screwing them in from the inside of the NeckPlateHigh. 

![NeckPlateHigh](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81597534/183765405-aae23bd1-547f-4da8-81f7-e413ce504817.png)

At the time of writing this, I still am using Jon Bailey's headstand and have yet to move to my Inmoov's body. Number of cables through the neck may increase as parts get further updated.

Bad Hair Day
=
If you have followed along so far and are using John Bailey's headstand then your build should look just like this. A BAD HAIR (wire) DAY!

YOUR JAW IS FINISHED!

Now we can move onto the 04-BrowPlate readme file for the following tutorial.
