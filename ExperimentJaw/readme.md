Rubber Bumpers/Feet/Dots are 6x2mm. 

Slide the insert upto the frontskull with frontskull on the table, glue it on with some superglue, insert the bumpers after that is dried.

The Insert has been updated and is now adjustable. You can extend or retract the bumpers as needed using M3 bolts.

I also printed and am using a different HingeLink for science. Not sure it makes any difference from the original one, but no issues. :9
