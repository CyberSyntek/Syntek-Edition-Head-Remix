Rubber Bumpers/Feet/Dots are 6x2mm. 

Slide the insert upto the frontskull with frontskull on the table, glue it on with some superglue, insert the bumpers after that is dried.


I also printed and am using a different HingeLink for science. Not sure it makes any difference from the original one, but no issues. :9
