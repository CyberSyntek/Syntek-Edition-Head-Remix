- MainPlate-JXedit.stl  (If using JX PDI-1181 servos)

NOTE: MainPlate-JXedit.stl is recommended to use instead of MainPlate.stl as it uses the more current servo set up.

- MainPlate.stl (Out dated - Was made for micro servos such as MG90D or MG92B) - I'll leave here as an option. 

- BaseConnector.stl - x12

- MainGear.stl  

  Note: This maingear is a very slightly altered version of Ray Edgley's custom MainGear file"

- GearRing.stl

- CamCableClip.stl - x2 (x4 if using two cameras.) 

MAINPLATE PREP

This video will help you prepare the MainPlate and the included neck files.

Note: The MainPlate.stl has been further adjusted since this video and may look slightly different. The clean up prep method and suggested methods remain the same with the current version. 

I suggest waiting to apply the grease to the MainGear as mentioned in the above video until you reach the "03-Jaw" folder tutorial in the readme file as the grease can get a bit messy. 

You will want them printed now to prepare and make sure everything fits well and will be reattaching them later on. 

Before you begin to print everything off, I suggest that you check the below video for the recommended calibration settings.

This should give you an idea on how you want your slicer calibrated for printing if you have any issues. I would suggest printing the Calibrator file from the InMoov website before you begin printing everything off. I've also included a potential neck option that you may want to use for your head project, or atleast until you are ready to get it onto the body of your robot.
