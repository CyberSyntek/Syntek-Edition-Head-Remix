MAINPLATE PREP

This video will help you prepare the MainPlate and the included neck files.

Note: The MainPlate.stl has been further adjusted since this video and may look slightly different. The clean up prep method and suggested methods remain the same with the current version. 

I suggest waiting to apply the grease to the MainGear as mentioned in the above video until you reach the "03-Jaw" folder tutorial in the readme file. 

You will want them printed now to prepare and make sure everything fits well and will be reattaching them later on. 

GETTING CALIBRATED / POTENTIAL NECK OPTIONS

This should give you an idea on how you want your slicer calibrated for printing if you have any issues. I would suggest printing the Calibrator file from the InMoov website before you begin printing everything off. I've also included a potential neck option that you may want to use for your head project, or atleast until you are ready to get it onto the body of your robot.
