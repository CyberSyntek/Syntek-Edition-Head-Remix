Note: The MainPlate.stl has been further adjusted since this video and may look slightly different. The clean up prep method and suggested methods remain the same with the current version. 

Note: I suggest waiting to apply the grease mentioned in the above video until you reach the "04-BrowPlate" folder tutorial in the readme file.
