MAINPLATE PREP & GETTING CALIBRATED
=
This video will help you prepare the MainPlate and give you an idea on how to calibrate your printer for the rest of the prints.

*EDIT* NEED TO UPDATE. Quality is too low. I will divide and upload the video files again for clearer picture.

Note: The MainPlate.stl has been further adjusted since this video and may look slightly different. The clean up prep method and suggested methods remain the same with the current version. 

Note: I suggest waiting to apply the grease to the MainGear as mentioned in the above video until you reach the "04-BrowPlate" folder tutorial in the readme file. You will likely need to remove it until then and grease can get messy!

TUTORIAL
=
The tutorial will begin in the "02-Eyes" folder readme file.
